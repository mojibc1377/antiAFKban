# antiAFKban
This Python script provides an anti-AFK (Away From Keyboard) solution designed to prevent users from being banned in games due to inactivity. It achieves this by simulating user activity at regular intervals, ensuring continuous engagement with the game environment.

Key Features:

Toggle Functionality: Users can toggle the script on and off using a specific key press, allowing flexibility and control over when the anti-AFK mechanism is active.
Customizable Parameters: Users can adjust parameters such as initial delay, total duration of activity, and interval between each simulated action to tailor the script to their specific needs.
Unobtrusive Operation: The script operates in the background with minimal system resource usage, ensuring smooth gameplay without interruptions.
Robustness: Utilizes libraries such as pyautogui and pynput for reliable simulation of keyboard input and key press detection, ensuring compatibility across various platforms and game environments.
Usage:

Install the required Python libraries: pyautogui and pynput.
Run the script, providing the necessary initial delay and other parameters as desired.
Press the designated key (i by default) to toggle the anti-AFK mechanism on and off during gameplay.
Enjoy uninterrupted gaming sessions without the risk of being banned due to inactivity.
Note: It's important to use this script responsibly and in accordance with the terms of service of the game being played. While the script aims to prevent AFK-related bans, it's essential to respect the rules and regulations set forth by game developers to maintain a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.
